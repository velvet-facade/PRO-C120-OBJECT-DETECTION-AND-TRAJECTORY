# PRO-C120-OBJECT-DETECTION-AND-TRAJECTORY
In Class 120, you learned to track the object in the video and plot its trajectory. In this project you’ll plot the trajectory of the tracked ball.
Story:
John and his friends were playing foot volleyball. John’s friend recorded a video of them 
playing together. John wanted to see how long they were able to keep the ball in the play, 
so he decided to create a tracking tool which will track the ball in the video.

Can you help John in creating the trajectory for the ball tracking?
